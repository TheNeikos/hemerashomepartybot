## Youtube Party Bot


This bot is intended to be played on a remote computer, connected to a screen
and audio output.

Upon adding them to a group, users there can share youtube links which will
then be played sequentially.

Those in the group are allowed to add, but not skip videos.

The maintainer can call the following commands:

- `/next`, will stop the current video and directly go to the next in the queue

Everyone can use the following commands:

- `/help`, to get a list of available commands
- `/queue`, to send a message containing all to be played videos.
